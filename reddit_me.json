I guess it’s a good thing I can recognize the cause pretty easily now. I used to live in the state more often than not: forgetting about me and letting everything else get my attention. \n\nThe attention I was giving to everyone and everything else wasn’t very good.

Where attention goes, energy flows - and boy did my energy flow out of me like a tire with a huge slash in it. \n\nThe past year has been one of exponential growth and it’s also been extremely humbling. Humanness, ah what a concept, what an experience we’re having here now. Once we think we have things figured out, universe gently (or intensely) reminds us that our existence here isn’t meant to be fully figured out. Maybe our purpose is to try our best and then to get better than what our best was yesterday, while accepting ourselves the whole time - regardless of how we do- regardless of if we “fail”. \n\nSo today, my best wasn’t stellar but it was the best I could do. I let work get to me. I let stress bother me more than usual. I didn’t take care of my body very well. I didn’t take a break. I had more anxiety than I’ve been experiencing as of recently. Just watching that today my best wasn’t super but that’s ok. I can regroup. I can re-learn the same lesson that I’ve been taught many times before because I sometimes forget it. I can let go. I can surrender. I’m calm now, my face is red and I’m nauseous as this train carries on, instead of going to yoga like I planned I’m just gonna sit and let this pass, maybe eat some healthy food since I didn’t do much of that today. This day doesn’t have to turn into a month of me not doing well. This day doesn’t have to turn into a year of me letting my old habits take over. I’ve learned, but I’m still working out the kinks. Tomorrow’s a new day, and I can do better. I will do better for myself because I deserve it. No need to beat myself up or eat a bunch of junk or drink a lot because emotions aren’t healed by outlets. They’re healed by sitting with them and letting them pass through. So that’s what I’m going to do. Let them pass. Let them flow. Let them go. \n\nWhatever you’re holding onto from today, if it was a shitty moment, a shitty experience, or an overall shitty day, try not to carry it into tomorrow. it doesn’t have to ruin your week, your weekend, your month, your year. It’s just a shitty day and that’s alright.\n\nSending love to whoever needs it.",

  "subreddit": "teenagers",
  "selftext": "As I was browsing this sub, I realised something. Girls have crushes just as much as boys, and they are just as much clueless about them as guys. So I tought I should give some advice to girls, hopefully it helps.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- The first, and probably most important thing, Is that you too can ask out guys. Most guys don't have crushes on everyone but would probably go out with most girls who ask them out. Don't try to send him signals and subtle clues because they rarley work on guys.\n\n\\- And this brings me to the second point. Why clues and subtle signs don't work on guys. Most guys oblivious to signals. And why you might ask? Most of the time they are so subtle that they go unnoticed, or if he notices them he won't think about them. The problem is with being subtle is that it's hard to decide if the girl is giving signals, flirting or just being friendly or kind. He will just think that you are friendly. You have to be painfully oblivious to him so he notices you want something from him.\n\n\\- Sometimes I hear girls saying \"Why would he choose me, he could get much better looking girls\", and all I can say is no one expect him (and maybe not even him) knows why he choose you, but he must have seen something in you. And you can ask him if you are really doubting yourself. But you are probably either a lot more attractive than you think or you have an awesome personality, and sometimes guys just fall in love with girls who are not even really attractive. You should just accept that he loves you and stop worrying.\n\n\\- If you have a problem please say it. Passive agressiveness and silent treatments won't work and just make things worse. Guys appreciate if you tell them straightforward that you have a problem with them.\n\n\\- Please if you don't want a first/second/third date then tell him instead of making excuses until he just gets fed up and leaves you alone or ghost him. He will apreciate it. And ghosting sucks. I have been ghosted once, and while I found the whole situation funny every guy hates it. If you can then tell him you don't want anything from him. (if he is agressive or something then obiviously don't do it in person)\n\n\\- If you really want to get a guy like you then compliment him. Guys never get complimets, especially on their looks, so even saying \"i like your shirt\" or \"nice haircut\" will make his week and It will significantly increase your chances, and it signals him that you like him.\n\n\\- This might be a bit inappropriate to say, but stop worrying how your body looks, especially when having sex. Not being comfortable is a lot more unattractive than any thing that you dont like about your body. Some girls worry about how their pussy looks, and honestly, guys dont care. There are some guys who do but they are assholes making you feel uncomfortable in your body. We dont care if your breasts are a bit uneven or that you have strech marks. We honestly dont care, especially in the heat of the moment.\n\n \n\nThis is all I could say, hope it helps someone and if you have a question leave a comment, or if you are afraid to ask you can pm me if you want.",

  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>As I was browsing this sub, I realised something. Girls have crushes just as much as boys, and they are just as much clueless about them as guys. So I tought I should give some advice to girls, hopefully it helps.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>- The first, and probably most important thing, Is that you too can ask out guys. Most guys don&#39;t have crushes on everyone but would probably go out with most girls who ask them out. Don&#39;t try to send him signals and subtle clues because they rarley work on guys.</p>\n\n<p>- And this brings me to the second point. Why clues and subtle signs don&#39;t work on guys. Most guys oblivious to signals. And why you might ask? Most of the time they are so subtle that they go unnoticed, or if he notices them he won&#39;t think about them. The problem is with being subtle is that it&#39;s hard to decide if the girl is giving signals, flirting or just being friendly or kind. He will just think that you are friendly. You have to be painfully oblivious to him so he notices you want something from him.</p>\n\n<p>- Sometimes I hear girls saying &quot;Why would he choose me, he could get much better looking girls&quot;, and all I can say is no one expect him (and maybe not even him) knows why he choose you, but he must have seen something in you. And you can ask him if you are really doubting yourself. But you are probably either a lot more attractive than you think or you have an awesome personality, and sometimes guys just fall in love with girls who are not even really attractive. You should just accept that he loves you and stop worrying.</p>\n\n<p>- If you have a problem please say it. Passive agressiveness and silent treatments won&#39;t work and just make things worse. Guys appreciate if you tell them straightforward that you have a problem with them.</p>\n\n<p>- Please if you don&#39;t want a first/second/third date then tell him instead of making excuses until he just gets fed up and leaves you alone or ghost him. He will apreciate it. And ghosting sucks. I have been ghosted once, and while I found the whole situation funny every guy hates it. If you can then tell him you don&#39;t want anything from him. (if he is agressive or something then obiviously don&#39;t do it in person)</p>\n\n<p>- If you really want to get a guy like you then compliment him. Guys never get complimets, especially on their looks, so even saying &quot;i like your shirt&quot; or &quot;nice haircut&quot; will make his week and It will significantly increase your chances, and it signals him that you like him.</p>\n\n<p>- This might be a bit inappropriate to say, but stop worrying how your body looks, especially when having sex. Not being comfortable is a lot more unattractive than any thing that you dont like about your body. Some girls worry about how their pussy looks, and honestly, guys dont care. There are some guys who do but they are assholes making you feel uncomfortable in your body. We dont care if your breasts are a bit uneven or that you have strech marks. We honestly dont care, especially in the heat of the moment.</p>\n\n<p>This is all I could say, hope it helps someone and if you have a question leave a comment, or if you are afraid to ask you can pm me if you want.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

  "selftext": "This is going to be lengthy, so \n\n**tl;dr** I spent 3 weeks (20 days) in a small cell in a Japanese detention center in absolute silence (no talking), without being allowed to contact anyone. All few days they tried to talk me into admit to the allegations. AMA? \n\n/edit: sorry, I mentioned it in the comments but I am trying to keep specifics/details about my case purposely vague to not have it get linked back to me. I'll try to answer as much as possible\n\n-- \n\nI got intercepted on my way to work by an innocent looking dude. Flashed me his badge, asked me to ID myself. Next thing, 6 other people appeared out of nowhere. More badges flashing, then asked me to open my door. They presented a court order to search my apartment, still not telling me what I did. \n\nThey took pictures of everything. Me unlocking the door, me allowing them to go inside, etc etc. Inside then, they started searching everything (inside protein powder, tea bags, under the bed, closets, clothes, etc) and asked questions if I ever had something intercepted by customs and if I had any idea why they were here. I said I was clueless, then they showed me a court order to arrest me. Seized my devices and asked me to surrender my password so they can \"prove that I am innocent\". I refused and they got upset and told me they can break into it anyway (they weren’t able to) and it might make my punishment worse if I have something to hide. \n\nNext thing I got cuffed and driven to the police station. No contact to anyone, not even my company that I can't go into work. More questions, pictures/fingerprints taken, then I got handed over to the detention facility. Had to take off my cloth, change into some stuff they prepared and then they threw me into a little cell with 1 other dude with absolutely nothing in it besides a small squat-toilet cabin (with a big window). Not even a chair or bench. Big signs everywhere to tell you that you are not allowed to talk, if you did police would come and tell you to shush. \n\nAnd here begins the nightmare. The detention center is no joke. It's not really bad per-se but it fucks with you mentally. The time table looks like this:\n\n**7:00**: Lights turn on. Well \"turn on\", they never really turn off. Just go from bright white to less bright orange. Take the sheets of your futon, fold everything neatly together and put it away when it's your turn. Then brush teeth and wash face. Then clean your cell with your cellmates (clean the toilet, wipe the floor, etc)\n\n**7:30 ~ 8:00**: Bento / breakfast, then you can decide if you want to change you underwear, tshirt and socks. Pants and sweater are permitted to change once a week. \n\n**8:30**: Cell check. Fold your socks neatly in front of you, sit next to them, put your hands on your knees facing up to show that you're not holding anything. Wait until your number is called and locks checked then say \"hai\"\n\n**9:00**: \"Workout\". You can go into a different small room without a ceiling to get some sunlight and fresh air for 20m. You can't really workout but there is place to actually sit. You can also shave or cut your nails\n\n**12:00**: Bento / lunch\n\n**17:00**: Bento / dinner\n\n**19:00**: Take out your futon, put the sheets on, wash face, brush teeth\n\n**21:00**: Lights off (well turn to less bright but still bright orange), sleeping time\n\nThe rest of the time you literally do nothing. You sit or lay in your cell on the hard floor wish you could sleep so time passes faster but you can't. It's too bright and after a while every part of  your body you tried laying on hurts. If you try using socks / sweater as a cushion you get told off by guards if they see it.\n\nThey have some books but english ones were only 4 (one being the little prince with like 100 pages) and if I read constantly I would have been finished with them after 3 days. So from morning until around 4pm I did nothing, then read 100 pages to \"save the book\" so I have something to do. Once a week you can order stuff from a CVS from a list they provide. Like a notebook, paper to write letters or some chips. \n\nEvery 4 days you're also allowed to take a shower/bath.\n\nThat's detention life. Some people I talked to literally told me they want to go to prison fast because life there is better and you can actually do stuff. \n\nOn the first day I got driven to the public prosecutor and my case presented. You get thrown into a different cell while cuffed with 10 other people but you can actually sit on a bench. It's like your doctors waiting room except you sit here for 6-8h until it's your turn, and then you have to wait until all the other people had their turn too before going back into the detention facility. Court ruled that I will be detained for 10 days (which then got extended by another 10 days after that - happens to almost everyone). Court also ruled that I will be disallowed to have any visitors or contact anyone besides the embassy or my lawyer. This also includes writing and receiving letters. For the rest of the world I just disappeared suddenly. \n\nEvery other day my detective took me out to interview me. I got moved into a tiny dry room and basically told that they already know that I am guilty and that I should admit it. The guy was a good cop and bad cop combined in one. The first few days he chatted about life, gave me tipps, asked my hobbies and what not and laughed a lot. As time passed this changed from friendly to just almost yelling at me that I did it. He was very skilled with words, often mixing things that had nothing to do with the case at all with things that had which caught me offguard sometimes. The first few interviews were to crosscheck my travel records, time in Japan, when I moved into my apartment and what not to see if I was lying. The last few were him asking me very angrily why I don't want to talk about the truth and if all people of my country are like that or if it's just me (＜国＞の人全員真実について話したくない？それかお前だけ？やったんでしょ？）\n\nHe also showed me a big folder with around 400-500 pages on what he found out about me and told me stuff like \"out of all people in Japan we arrived at your door, think about that. We know you're guilty, just admit it\". I later was able to peek a bit into the folder and while yes it was stuff about me, it was stuff like my social profiles and pictures printed on a4 pages, travel records and what not. My cell mate told me that it's a dummy used for intimidation mainly. \n\nThe interviews are stressful mentally but everything that is being written into a report has to get signed (with your fingerprint) by you so if it contains something you don't want to sign you can refuse and ask them to take it out. The public prosecutor interviews however are video/audio recorded so one wrong word and you're over with (also meant that he can't play any tricks because he's recorded too so it's a good thing in some way) \n\nThe other days I met with my lawyer to have some sort of contact to the outside world but he told me from the beginning that deportation is a very high chance and I shouldn't expect anything else. \n\nSo for 20 days this was my life. I was never able to sleep through the night in one go due to the light (usually woke up ~4 times), my body hurt everywhere, I wasn't allowed to talk a word to anyone (still did in secret though and me and my cellmate became good friends in the end), and every other day I got told that I am guilty and that I should admit. Weekends are the worst because there are no interviews and no \"workout\". It's just nothing the entire day. After a while I got very detached from reality. It all seemed like a long dream and days just blurred into each other. A lot of time to think about all the possible ways this will go wrong and that deportation is just around the corner. I luckily had a doctors prescription for Xanax so they basically told me to either take it as prescribed (once in the morning, once in the evening) or not take it at all and they’ll trash it. It got me through the worst but I might have developed a dependency on it\n\nAlso cold bento x 3 every damn day. Bento bento bento. You can order a piece of custard bread with each meal for 150 yen ($1.50 USD) and that was the main thing I looked forward to each day. I was lucky to get arrested with cash otherwise that wouldn't have been possible. \n\nAfter 20 days it's either court or freedom since they can't keep you any longer without prosecuting. In my case the charges got dropped and I got released. \n\nAll in all, 2/10, wouldn't recommend. Food was monotone but ok and free.",

  "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>This is going to be lengthy, so </p>\n\n<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> I spent 3 weeks (20 days) in a small cell in a Japanese detention center in absolute silence (no talking), without being allowed to contact anyone. All few days they tried to talk me into admit to the allegations. AMA? </p>\n\n<p>/edit: sorry, I mentioned it in the comments but I am trying to keep specifics/details about my case purposely vague to not have it get linked back to me. I&#39;ll try to answer as much as possible</p>\n\n<h2></h2>\n\n<p>I got intercepted on my way to work by an innocent looking dude. Flashed me his badge, asked me to ID myself. Next thing, 6 other people appeared out of nowhere. More badges flashing, then asked me to open my door. They presented a court order to search my apartment, still not telling me what I did. </p>\n\n<p>They took pictures of everything. Me unlocking the door, me allowing them to go inside, etc etc. Inside then, they started searching everything (inside protein powder, tea bags, under the bed, closets, clothes, etc) and asked questions if I ever had something intercepted by customs and if I had any idea why they were here. I said I was clueless, then they showed me a court order to arrest me. Seized my devices and asked me to surrender my password so they can &quot;prove that I am innocent&quot;. I refused and they got upset and told me they can break into it anyway (they weren’t able to) and it might make my punishment worse if I have something to hide. </p>\n\n<p>Next thing I got cuffed and driven to the police station. No contact to anyone, not even my company that I can&#39;t go into work. More questions, pictures/fingerprints taken, then I got handed over to the detention facility. Had to take off my cloth, change into some stuff they prepared and then they threw me into a little cell with 1 other dude with absolutely nothing in it besides a small squat-toilet cabin (with a big window). Not even a chair or bench. Big signs everywhere to tell you that you are not allowed to talk, if you did police would come and tell you to shush. </p>\n\n<p>And here begins the nightmare. The detention center is no joke. It&#39;s not really bad per-se but it fucks with you mentally. The time table looks like this:</p>\n\n<p><strong>7:00</strong>: Lights turn on. Well &quot;turn on&quot;, they never really turn off. Just go from bright white to less bright orange. Take the sheets of your futon, fold everything neatly together and put it away when it&#39;s your turn. Then brush teeth and wash face. Then clean your cell with your cellmates (clean the toilet, wipe the floor, etc)</p>\n\n<p><strong>7:30 ~ 8:00</strong>: Bento / breakfast, then you can decide if you want to change you underwear, tshirt and socks. Pants and sweater are permitted to change once a week. </p>\n\n<p><strong>8:30</strong>: Cell check. Fold your socks neatly in front of you, sit next to them, put your hands on your knees facing up to show that you&#39;re not holding anything. Wait until your number is called and locks checked then say &quot;hai&quot;</p>\n\n<p><strong>9:00</strong>: &quot;Workout&quot;. You can go into a different small room without a ceiling to get some sunlight and fresh air for 20m. You can&#39;t really workout but there is place to actually sit. You can also shave or cut your nails</p>\n\n<p><strong>12:00</strong>: Bento / lunch</p>\n\n<p><strong>17:00</strong>: Bento / dinner</p>\n\n<p><strong>19:00</strong>: Take out your futon, put the sheets on, wash face, brush teeth</p>\n\n<p><strong>21:00</strong>: Lights off (well turn to less bright but still bright orange), sleeping time</p>\n\n<p>The rest of the time you literally do nothing. You sit or lay in your cell on the hard floor wish you could sleep so time passes faster but you can&#39;t. It&#39;s too bright and after a while every part of  your body you tried laying on hurts. If you try using socks / sweater as a cushion you get told off by guards if they see it.</p>\n\n<p>They have some books but english ones were only 4 (one being the little prince with like 100 pages) and if I read constantly I would have been finished with them after 3 days. So from morning until around 4pm I did nothing, then read 100 pages to &quot;save the book&quot; so I have something to do. Once a week you can order stuff from a CVS from a list they provide. Like a notebook, paper to write letters or some chips. </p>\n\n<p>Every 4 days you&#39;re also allowed to take a shower/bath.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s detention life. Some people I talked to literally told me they want to go to prison fast because life there is better and you can actually do stuff. </p>\n\n<p>On the first day I got driven to the public prosecutor and my case presented. You get thrown into a different cell while cuffed with 10 other people but you can actually sit on a bench. It&#39;s like your doctors waiting room except you sit here for 6-8h until it&#39;s your turn, and then you have to wait until all the other people had their turn too before going back into the detention facility. Court ruled that I will be detained for 10 days (which then got extended by another 10 days after that - happens to almost everyone). Court also ruled that I will be disallowed to have any visitors or contact anyone besides the embassy or my lawyer. This also includes writing and receiving letters. For the rest of the world I just disappeared suddenly. </p>\n\n<p>Every other day my detective took me out to interview me. I got moved into a tiny dry room and basically told that they already know that I am guilty and that I should admit it. The guy was a good cop and bad cop combined in one. The first few days he chatted about life, gave me tipps, asked my hobbies and what not and laughed a lot. As time passed this changed from friendly to just almost yelling at me that I did it. He was very skilled with words, often mixing things that had nothing to do with the case at all with things that had which caught me offguard sometimes. The first few interviews were to crosscheck my travel records, time in Japan, when I moved into my apartment and what not to see if I was lying. The last few were him asking me very angrily why I don&#39;t want to talk about the truth and if all people of my country are like that or if it&#39;s just me (＜国＞の人全員真実について話したくない？それかお前だけ？やったんでしょ？）</p>\n\n<p>He also showed me a big folder with around 400-500 pages on what he found out about me and told me stuff like &quot;out of all people in Japan we arrived at your door, think about that. We know you&#39;re guilty, just admit it&quot;. I later was able to peek a bit into the folder and while yes it was stuff about me, it was stuff like my social profiles and pictures printed on a4 pages, travel records and what not. My cell mate told me that it&#39;s a dummy used for intimidation mainly. </p>\n\n<p>The interviews are stressful mentally but everything that is being written into a report has to get signed (with your fingerprint) by you so if it contains something you don&#39;t want to sign you can refuse and ask them to take it out. The public prosecutor interviews however are video/audio recorded so one wrong word and you&#39;re over with (also meant that he can&#39;t play any tricks because he&#39;s recorded too so it&#39;s a good thing in some way) </p>\n\n<p>The other days I met with my lawyer to have some sort of contact to the outside world but he told me from the beginning that deportation is a very high chance and I shouldn&#39;t expect anything else. </p>\n\n<p>So for 20 days this was my life. I was never able to sleep through the night in one go due to the light (usually woke up ~4 times), my body hurt everywhere, I wasn&#39;t allowed to talk a word to anyone (still did in secret though and me and my cellmate became good friends in the end), and every other day I got told that I am guilty and that I should admit. Weekends are the worst because there are no interviews and no &quot;workout&quot;. It&#39;s just nothing the entire day. After a while I got very detached from reality. It all seemed like a long dream and days just blurred into each other. A lot of time to think about all the possible ways this will go wrong and that deportation is just around the corner. I luckily had a doctors prescription for Xanax so they basically told me to either take it as prescribed (once in the morning, once in the evening) or not take it at all and they’ll trash it. It got me through the worst but I might have developed a dependency on it</p>\n\n<p>Also cold bento x 3 every damn day. Bento bento bento. You can order a piece of custard bread with each meal for 150 yen ($1.50 USD) and that was the main thing I looked forward to each day. I was lucky to get arrested with cash otherwise that wouldn&#39;t have been possible. </p>\n\n<p>After 20 days it&#39;s either court or freedom since they can&#39;t keep you any longer without prosecuting. In my case the charges got dropped and I got released. </p>\n\n<p>All in all, 2/10, wouldn&#39;t recommend. Food was monotone but ok and free.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I was removed from the house we were living at,so I ended up staying with friends as I couldnt afford to live on my own.\n\nI couldnt live on my own because I only have a part time job in retail. Jobs okay but not enough hours so I have been looking for other work. But no-one will employ me. \n\nIts been like this for 10 months now,nothing has changed apart from my wife has now moved over 2 hours away so I cannot even see my daughter much,plus she won't let me see her as shes always busy apparently. I really dont know what to do,I got pulled into the office a couple of days ago as my managers have noticed a change in me,they know the situation. They apparently want to give me a better hours contract but cannot afford it due to head office etc.\n\nI also have until the 9th of September to move out. Its fair enough,they never had to take me in the first place,they have been very sympathetic with everything. \n\nRooms around here are generally around £500 a month,I earn £550 if theres no overtime. But theres one room for £300 but theres no oven,fridge or freezer and cannot have my daughter there if I ever get to see her. So im kinda stuck. \n\nI just don't want to be here anymore. Theres so much I have to deal with but haven't managed to sort a single thing out. When this divorce is done I will most likely be broke for the rest of my life aswell as lonely and unhappy.\n\nI don't want to be in retail on part time,Id like to be a department manager as atleast I would always be busy and can afford to survive but nothings come. Ive been to a few interviews but literally nothing has come from them and its just a motivation killer. Ive got no experience in any other job sectors so im stuck....",

Its fair enough,they never had to take me in the first place,they have been very sympathetic with everything. </p>\n\n<p>Rooms around here are generally around £500 a month,I earn £550 if theres no overtime. But theres one room for £300 but theres no oven,fridge or freezer and cannot have my daughter there if I ever get to see her. So im kinda stuck. </p>\n\n<p>I just don&#39;t want to be here anymore. Theres so much I have to deal with but haven&#39;t managed to sort a single thing out. When this divorce is done I will most likely be broke for the rest of my life aswell as lonely and unhappy.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t want to be in retail on part time,Id like to be a department manager as atleast I would always be busy and can afford to survive but nothings come. Ive been to a few interviews but literally nothing has come from them and its just a motivation killer. Ive got no experience in any other job sectors so im stuck....</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
