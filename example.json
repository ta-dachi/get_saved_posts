When they needed homework help, I'd ask them to solve the problems together and come to me if they had any questions (while I pretended to catch up on work but actually played GTA on my laptop). Sometimes I'd overhear them talking and getting to know each other -- it was cute. He sure did make my life a hell of a lot easier. ",

Forcing the people to compress more and more complicated ideas into simpler and simpler language - literally forcing the people to be unable to adequately communicate ideas that went against ingsoc.\n\nWhat we’re seeing here is an attempt to add further nuance to a language - instead of classing ‘intelligence’ as solely to do with academic achievement is extremely clunky, and actually masks the reality (as we currently understand it) of multiple areas in which our minds can excel.\n\nFrankly, it’s an attempt to get away from the simple, clunky words being used to describe highly complex concepts.\n\nIt’s the same with trans and cis. The purpose is to add greater nuance to a language - allowing one to distinguish where necessary, but also combine where more useful. Is it at the same level as the other example? No. Could an argument be made that it obfuscates and erases the ‘natural’ definition of woman? I would very much disagree, but it could be made.\n\nBut yeah, to get back to the main point: this is actually the opposite of newspeak.
